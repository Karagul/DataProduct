Included in this project are eight files.  The files are ui.R and server.R for the stock prediction and analysis Shiny tool.
Also, the slidify presentation file, stockAnalysisPresentationSlides.html, is included, too.  Finally, since rPubs has a bug 
temporally with slidify slides, I will post five slides in JPG format.  The file names are stockAnalysisPresentationSlide1.JPG, 
stockAnalysisPresentationSlide2.JPG, stockAnalysisPresentationSlide3.JPG, stockAnalysisPresentationSlide4.JPG, and 
stockAnalysisPresentationSlide5.JPG.  The rPubs file without any slides is at http://rpubs.com/blei_rpubs/207564.
